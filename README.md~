# TimeKicker

App for user time restrictions

This app is written in Python and needs PyQt library for running. You can manage profiles for time restrictions to restrict user from using computer during some time periods a day or for limit time a day (e.g. using computer only 90 minutes a day). Than You can assign this profile for user or even for whole group of users in Linux.

App is writing all settings in PICKLE files to users home folder:
	- first file is .tc_settings.p
	- second files is -tc_stats.p

Settings file is used for saving settings, stats file is used to save user stats of computer using and then You are able to view these activities from admin tools.

This is just BASIC test version! If You are interested in this project, then contact me at jiri.holomek@gmail.com.
